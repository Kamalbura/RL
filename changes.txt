RL System – Change Log and Impact Summary
Date: 2025-08-28

Overview
This document summarizes the refactor and enhancements made to the hierarchical RL system (tactical DDoS side + strategic crypto side), the rationale behind each change, and the expected positive effects for the team.

High‑impact changes
1) Introduced shared Deep Q‑Network (DQN)
- File: shared/dqn_agent.py
- What: Reusable DQN with target network, Double DQN option, dueling head, replay buffer, epsilon decay, save/load (.pt).
- Why: Move beyond tabular Q‑learning to support continuous/normalized states and better generalization.
- Effect: Improved learning capacity, stability, and maintainability (single implementation used by both agents).

2) Tactical environment: continuous state, factored actions, normalized rewards
- File: ddos_rl/env.py
- What:
  - Observation space → Box[0,1]^5: [Threat, Battery, CPU_Load, Task_Priority, Temperature]. Thermal is now observable.
  - Action space → Tuple(Discrete(3), Discrete(4)):
    • model_choice: 0=DE‑ESCALATE, 1=XGBOOST, 2=TST
    • freq_choice: 0=POWERSAVE, 1=BALANCED, 2=PERFORMANCE, 3=TURBO
  - Reward → bounded, normalized components (thermal, energy, latency, security, context) in [-1, 1].
  - Battery drain via Wh model; thermal estimation fallback retained.
- Why: Fix hidden‑state aliasing (thermal used in reward but not state), separate decisions for better sample efficiency, stabilize training with bounded rewards.
- Effect: More stable learning; safer thermal behavior; clearer decisions (choose model vs frequency separately); better reproducibility.

3) Tactical agent migrated to DQN
- File: ddos_rl/agent.py
- What: Replaced tabular QLearningAgent with TacticalAgent that wraps shared DQN; added flatten_action/unflatten_action helpers for tuple actions.
- Effect: Supports continuous states and new action structure; shared save/load to .pt.

4) Tactical training updated for DQN
- File: ddos_rl/train.py
- What: Uses TacticalAgent (DQN), stores experiences, learns every step, logs to CSV, saves checkpoints as .pt (tactical_dqn.pt, tactical_dqn_best.pt).
- Effect: Better learning dynamics and clearer artifacts; compatible with new env.

5) Strategic crypto environment and agent modernization
- File: crypto_rl/strategic_agent.py
- What:
  - Env: Observation → Box[0,1]^4: [Threat, AvgFleetBattery, MissionPhase, SwarmConsensusThreat]; normalized reward components (security+, power‑, latency‑) using shared profiles.
  - Agent: StrategicCryptoAgent now uses DQN via CryptoDQNAgent (in crypto_rl/rl_agent.py).
  - CSV logging simplified (epsilon + rewards); best policy saved as strategic_crypto_dqn_best.pt.
- Effect: Stable training signals; consistent data source; removal of tabular constraints.

6) Strategic simulator fixed and aligned
- File: crypto_rl/crypto_simulator.py
- What: Fixed indentation/syntax; aligned to Box state and normalized reward model; uses shared get_algorithm_performance.
- Effect: Usable simulator consistent with strategic env; avoids duplicate/contradictory logic.

7) Strategic agent implementation switched to DQN
- File: crypto_rl/rl_agent.py
- What: Replaced legacy QLearningAgent with CryptoDQNAgent wrapper around shared DQN.
- Effect: Shared learning core across both agents; uniform API (choose_action/remember/learn/save/load).

8) Integration wiring updates
- File: integration/system_coordinator.py
- What: Switched tactical controller to use TacticalAgent (DQN) and tuple action decoding (unflatten_action). Strategic controller now uses StrategicCryptoAgent.
- Effect: Runtime controllers aligned with new agents and action semantics.
- Note: Minor indentation fixes may still be needed; see “Follow‑ups”.

9) Dependencies
- File: requirements.txt
- What: Ensured gymnasium listed for Box/Tuple spaces; torch already present.
- Effect: Environment consistency for new spaces and DQN.

Behavioral changes and migration notes
- Policies file format/names:
  - Tactical: .pt (tactical_dqn.pt / tactical_dqn_best.pt) replaces old .npy Q‑tables.
  - Strategic: strategic_crypto_dqn.pt replaces strategic_crypto_q_table.npy.
- Action semantics (tactical):
  - Old: Discrete(9) (coupled model+freq)
  - New: Tuple(3,4) with helpers in ddos_rl/agent.py to map to a flat index if needed.
- Observation shapes:
  - Tactical: now 5 normalized floats (includes temperature)
  - Strategic: now 4 normalized floats (includes swarm consensus threat)
- Reward scaling: Components bounded and summed in [-1,1] for both envs. Expect smoother learning curves and more stable evaluation.

Expected positive effects (why this helps the team)
- Stability & sample efficiency: Normalized rewards and factored actions reduce variance and accelerate learning.
- Observability & safety: Thermal is part of the tactical state; policy will proactively avoid unsafe frequencies under high temps/low battery.
- Consistency & maintainability: Both agents use a single DQN implementation; performance data comes from shared profiles; fewer duplicated codepaths.
- Extensibility: Continuous/normalized states let us add features without exploding tabular sizes; DQN can be tuned (dueling/double/target sync).
- Cleaner artifacts & logs: Standardized .pt policies, periodic checkpoints, and simpler CSV logs enable easier experiment management.

How to work with the new setup (quick guide)
- Tactical training entry: ddos_rl/train.py → train_tactical_agent()
- Strategic training entry: crypto_rl/strategic_agent.py → train_strategic_agent()
- Policies: load/save via agent.save_policy()/load_policy() (PyTorch .pt bundles)
- Action mapping (tactical): use flatten_action/unflatten_action from ddos_rl/agent.py if you need a single integer action.

Known follow‑ups (recommended)
- Tests: Update integration tests that assume tabular Q‑tables and Discrete(9) tactical actions.
- Profiles: Remove/retire legacy hardcoded ddos_rl/profiles.py to avoid drift; rely on shared.crypto_profiles.
- Integration: Finish minor indentation fixes in integration/system_coordinator.py if any remain in your editor diagnostics.
- Docs: Refresh README.md examples to reflect DQN agents, new policy filenames, and normalized states/actions.

Status
- Smoke tests executed: tactical and strategic envs reset/step OK in rl_env; imports for training and agents succeed.
- Gymnasium/torch present in the conda env.
