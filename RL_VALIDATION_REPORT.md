# RL Validation Report

## 1. Executive Summary
Based on `changes.txt`, the refactor aimed to increase stability, observability, and efficiency by migrating from tabular Q-Learning to a shared Deep Q-Network (DQN), adopting continuous/normalized state spaces, factoring the tactical action space, and consolidating on shared data-driven profiles.

Verdict: The current codebase implements these changes successfully in all core areas. Both agents use the shared DQN, environments expose normalized Box observations, tactical actions are factored, and reward functions are normalized and sourced from shared profiles. Minor follow-ups remain (tests referencing legacy profiles; doc updates), but the architecture is coherent and ready for training and integration.

Top findings:
- VERIFIED: Shared DQN (`shared/dqn_agent.py`) with target network, Double/Dueling options, replay, and .pt persistence.
- VERIFIED: Tactical env now Box[0,1]^5 including temperature; Tuple(3,4) actions; reward components bounded; tactical agent and trainer migrated to DQN.
- ISSUE (minor): Integration tests still import `ddos_rl/profiles.py`; should be updated to shared profiles. The integration controller wiring was updated to DQN and tuple actions and passes a quick static check.

## 2. Validation Checklist and Findings

### Change 1: Shared DQN Agent (shared/dqn_agent.py)
- Existence/Features: File present with `DQNAgent` and `DQNConfig` implementing
  - Target network sync (`target_sync_freq`) and copy on init
  - Experience replay buffer (`deque`), batch sampling, and SmoothL1 loss
  - Double DQN optional path for next action selection
  - Dueling architecture support in `MLP`
  - Epsilon-greedy with linear decay and save/load (.pt)
- Finding: VERIFIED

### Change 2 & 3: Tactical Environment & Agent (ddos_rl/env.py, ddos_rl/agent.py)
- Observation: `spaces.Box(low=0, high=1, shape=(5,))` with state from `_get_state()` → `[threat, battery, cpu_load, task_priority, temp_norm]` (temp included).
- Action: `spaces.Tuple((spaces.Discrete(3), spaces.Discrete(4)))` representing model and CPU frequency separately.
- Reward: `_calculate_reward` returns bounded sum of normalized components (thermal, energy, latency, security, context), with de-escalation path also bounded.
- Agent: `ddos_rl/agent.py` defines `TacticalAgent` that wraps shared `DQNAgent` plus `flatten_action`/`unflatten_action` helpers.
- Finding: VERIFIED

### Change 5 & 7: Strategic Environment & Agent (crypto_rl/strategic_agent.py, crypto_rl/rl_agent.py)
- Observation: `spaces.Box(low=0, high=1, shape=(4,))` with state `[Threat, AvgFleetBattery, MissionPhase, SwarmConsensusThreat]`.
- Reward: Normalized components from shared profiles via `get_algorithm_performance` with final clip to [-1,1].
- Agent: `crypto_rl/rl_agent.py` implements `CryptoDQNAgent`, a thin wrapper around shared `DQNAgent` with identical API.
- Finding: VERIFIED

### Change 8: Integration Wiring (integration/system_coordinator.py)
- Tactical controller: Instantiates `TacticalAgent` and uses `unflatten_action` to decode flat actions for hardware execution; DQN action selection used at runtime.
- Strategic controller: Instantiates `StrategicCryptoAgent` (DQN-based).
- Static check shows no errors; earlier indentation issues were resolved.
- Finding: VERIFIED (note: keep an eye on hardware frequency table and ensure TURBO maps per env safety constraints).

### Change 9: Dependencies (requirements.txt)
- `gymnasium>=0.29.0` and `torch>=1.9.0` are present; psutil/numpy present. Suitable for DQN and Box/Tuple spaces.
- Finding: VERIFIED

## 3. Deep Dive: Reward Function Analysis

### Tactical (`ddos_rl/env.py`)
- Uses shared profile function `get_ddos_performance(model, cores, frequency)`.
- Components:
  - Thermal: bounded within [-1,0.2] depending on thermal state and frequency, then combined with others and clipped
  - Energy: `-clip((watts-3)/12, 0,1)` → in [-1,0]
  - Latency: `-clip(lat_ms/500, 0,1)` → in [-1,0]
  - Security: `clip((acc-0.85)/(1-0.85),0,1)*threat_w` then clipped to [0,1]
  - Context: [0,1] based on load/priority preferences
- Final: `np.clip(sum, -1, 1)` ensuring bounded reward.
- Conclusion: Components are normalized/bounded and sourced from shared profiles. Matches change log intent.

### Strategic (`crypto_rl/strategic_agent.py`)
- Uses shared `get_algorithm_performance(algo, cores=4, frequency=1800)`.
- Components:
  - Security: `clip(security_rating/10,0,1)` weighted by threat/consensus, clipped to [0,1]
  - Power: `-clip((W-3)/17,0,1)` with harsher penalty when battery < 40%
  - Latency: `-clip(ms/1000,0,1)` weighted by mission phase severity
- Final: `clip(sum, -1, 1)`.
- Conclusion: Normalization and bounding are correctly implemented; data flow from shared profiles is in place.

## 4. Code Coherence and Single Source of Truth Audit
- Legacy profiles: `ddos_rl/profiles.py` still exists and is referenced only in `tests/test_integration.py`. No active runtime module imports it; runtime now uses `shared.crypto_profiles`.
  - Recommendation: Update tests to use shared profiles and/or remove legacy file after test refactor.
- Strategic env consistency: Both `crypto_rl/strategic_agent.py` and `crypto_rl/crypto_simulator.py` pull performance from `shared.crypto_profiles.get_algorithm_performance` and expose normalized Box states with consensus threat; logic is aligned.
- Remaining hardcoded values:
  - Tactical CPU preset MHz and thermal thresholds (e.g., 600/1200/1800; thermal bands) are constants in the env; acceptable for now but could be centralized in `shared/system_profiles.py` for full single-source governance.
  - Strategic uses nominal cores/frequency (4, 1800) inline; could be configurable.

## 5. Final Recommendations and Known Follow-ups
- Update tests: Replace imports from `ddos_rl/profiles.py` with shared profiles; adjust assertions for new spaces (Tuple action, Box observations) and .pt policy files.
- Documentation: Update README and examples to reflect DQN agents, normalized states, new policy filenames, and how to use flatten/unflatten.
- Configurability: Externalize DQN hyperparameters and env normalization bands (e.g., power/latency ranges, thermal thresholds) into a config file for easier tuning.
- Integration safety: Align system coordinator frequency list with env presets and ensure TURBO behavior remains thermally safe.

Readiness: The refactor has addressed core architectural flaws and aligns with the `changes.txt` goals. With test updates and minor config centralization, the system is ready for live integration testing and training runs using the provided .pt policies.
